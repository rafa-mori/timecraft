- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Code Formatting

Before submitting code, please run:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black timecraft_ai/ examples/ tests/

# Check code style with flake8
flake8 timecraft_ai/ examples/ tests/

# Type checking with mypy
mypy timecraft_ai/
```

### Documentation

- Write clear and concise docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Follow [Google style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Update documentation when adding new features

### Commit Messages

def test_function_name_should_return_expected_result():
    # Arrange
    input_data = ...
    expected_result = ...
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_result
```
