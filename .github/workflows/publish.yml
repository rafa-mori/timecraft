name: Publish to PyPI

# Workflow will run only for actors that are relevant to publishing a new version of the package to PyPI.
# This includes pull requests, pushes to tags that match semantic versioning, and manual triggers.
# The workflow is designed to ensure that the package is built, versioned correctly, and published to PyPI only when appropriate conditions are met.
# The workflow is triggered by the following events (only by faelmori, all of them):
# - Pull requests targeting the main branch
# - Pushes that create or update tags matching the semantic versioning pattern `v*.*.*`
# - Manual triggers via the GitHub Actions UI
# - Scheduled runs (commented out, can be enabled for daily builds)

on:
  # The `pull_request` event triggers the workflow when a pull request is opened, synchronized, or reopened.
  # This is useful for running tests and checks on code changes before they are merged into the main branch.
  # The `branches` filter ensures that the workflow only runs for pull requests targeting the main branch.
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]  # Run on pull request events
    # The `branches` filter ensures that the workflow only runs for pull requests targeting the main
    branches:
      - main  # Run for pull requests targeting the main branch

  # The `push` event triggers the workflow when code is pushed to the repository.
  # The `tags` filter ensures that the workflow only runs for pushes that create or update tags matching the semantic versioning pattern `v*.*.*`.
  # This is typically used for publishing new releases to PyPI.
  # The `v*.*.*` pattern matches tags like `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`, etc., which follow semantic versioning.
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*.*.*"  # Run for tags that match semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)

  # The `workflow_dispatch` event allows the workflow to be triggered manually from the GitHub Actions UI.
  # This is useful for cases where you want to publish a new version to PyPI without needing to push a new commit or tag.
  # It allows for more flexibility in managing releases and deployments.
  workflow_dispatch:
  # The `schedule` event allows the workflow to run on a regular schedule.
  # The `cron` expression specifies that the workflow should run every day at midnight UTC.
  # schedule:
  #   - cron: "0 0 * * *"  # Run daily at midnight UTC

permissions:
  contents: write  # Allows the workflow to push changes to the repository, such as tags
  packages: write  # Allows the workflow to publish packages to PyPI
  id-token: write  # Allows the workflow to request an ID token for authentication with external services

jobs:
  # The `deploy-constraints` job is responsible for checking if the actor is allowed to deploy.
  # It ensures that only authorized users can trigger the deployment process.
  # This is important to prevent unauthorized deployments and ensure that only trusted contributors can publish new versions to PyPI.
  # The job runs on the latest version of Ubuntu and performs a series of checks to validate the actor's permissions and the context of the workflow trigger.
  # If any of the checks fail, the job exits with an error message, preventing the deployment from proceeding.
