Quick Start:
    >>> import timecraft
    >>> # For time series analysis
    >>> model = timecraft.TimeCraftAI()
    >>> # For AI features (if available)
    >>> if timecraft.AI_AVAILABLE:
    ...     chatbot = timecraft.ChatbotActions()

    # e.g., python -m timecraft_ai
    # or python -m timecraft (if installed as a package)
    # This is useful for quick sanity checks without needing a full test suite
    # It will print basic info and test core functionality
    # This is not a full test suite, just a quick sanity check
    # It can be expanded later with more detailed tests if needed
    # For now, it serves as a quick way to verify the package is working
    # and can be used in both development and production environments
